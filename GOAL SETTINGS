KRA (50%):------


DATABASE ADMINISTRATOR  (20%):

Knowledge about Databases of our applications like we have AMSPRD, LBERTYDB, IMBDB and BAWDB to handle flight data. 
Responsible for maintaining, securing, and operating databases and also ensures that data is correctly stored and retrieved.

MAINTAIN DATABASE HIGH AVAILABILITES :-

RAC:-
1. Monitoring Both primary and secondary servers are active and handle traffic, providing load balancing and high availability.
2. Monitoring processors, database running status, services running status and all listeners working status checking in RAC.
3. Perform regular database maintenance tasks such as indexing, statistics updates, and consistency checks to ensure optimal performance and reliability.
4. Updating, maintaining, and querying databases, tables, views, indexes, and other objects related to airport flight data. 
5. Checking Nodes availability, cluster status checking, disk groups space utilization and based on requirement add the disks into disk groups.
6. Apply security patches and updates regularly to protect against vulnerabilities and ensure stability.
7. Implement strict access controls to limit who can access and make changes to the database.

DATAGUARD:-
1. Monitoring the MRP process status, Archives shippings and applying status checkup from primary to standby.
2. Checking the gaps between primary to standby in sync are not data blocks transferring.
3. Incase of huge gaps resolve the gaps by using of service name.
4. Develop and regularly test a disaster recovery plan to ensure quick restoration of database services in the event of a major failure.
5. Implement point-in-time recovery to restore the database to a specific time, minimizing data loss in case of an incident.


Improve Database Performance:- (10%)

1. Monitoring database performance, ensuring data quality and security, solving problems and collaborating with other teams to resolve tickets/issues.
2. Monitoring blocking sessions, inactive sessions after that resolved issues also check table space usage checkup.
3. Updating existing tables in DB with updated flight information also cleaning archives, mount point, data quality, consistency and availability.
4. Conduct a comprehensive performance audit of the current database.Identify slow-performing queries and database bottlenecks.
5. Implement indexing on high-impact tables.Optimize slow-performing queries identified during the audit and Adjust indexing and query optimizations based on results.




Enhance Backup and Recovery Processes :- (10%)

1. Monitoring the backups daily and scheduling jobs for backups in crontab. In case of backup fails taking backups manually.
2. Identify areas for improvement and select a more efficient backup solution.
3. Implement a more efficient backup solution and conduct regular recovery tests.
4. Based on our requirement taking backups and restore the databases and recover the databases.
5. Based on our requirement data pump activities,schemas refreshments doing by using of EXPDP and IMPDP.



Monitoring Applications :- (10%)

Need to be acquiring more knowledge! on AMS applications and   middleware applications.
Solving issues related to Staff page, ASO, Airlines, HR compliance etc.
