Switching over a database

Switching over a database in Oracle involves transitioning from the primary database to a standby database. Here are basic steps for a manual switchover:
 
1. **Check Prerequisites:**
      - Verify that the databases are running in ARCHIVELOG mode :-
 
      - Confirm the Data Guard configuration is properly set up :-
 
      - Ensure both primary and standby databases are in sync :-
  
Query on standby( database for applied archivelogs and compare it with primary archives.

2. **Connect to the Primary Database:**
   - Connect to the primary database using SQL*Plus or another SQL client.
 
3. **Check Switchover Readiness:**
   - Verify the readiness of the standby database for switchover:
   - First we should know the database name, role, dB unique name, mode IN BOTH SIDES.

 SQL > set lines 300 pages 300;
SELECT sequence#, first_time, next_time, applied FROM v$archived_log ORDER BY sequence#;
 
If sync between DC1 and DC2 is  not happening the know the gap status:-
------------------------
primary> SQL > select STATUS, GAP_STATUS from V$ARCHIVE_DEST_STATUS where DEST_ID = 2;
 

standby> SQL > select NAME, VALUE, DATUM_TIME from V$DATAGUARD_STATS;

To know the switch over status:-
--------------------------------
primary> SQL > select SWITCHOVER_STATUS from V$DATABASE;

 
 Stop the instance-2 on both primary and standby databases.
4. **Initiate Switchover on Primary:**
   - On the primary database, initiate the switchover:
     SQL >	ALTER DATABASE COMMIT TO SWITCHOVER TO PHYSICAL STANDBY WITH SESSION SHUTDOWN;
 
5. **Monitor Switchover Progress:**
   - Monitor the switchover progress using:
	 SQL >	SELECT SWITCHOVER_STATUS FROM V$DATABASE;
  And also monitor the Alert logfile.
 
6. **Connect to the Standby Database:**
7. **Complete Switchover:**
   - On the standby database, complete the switchover:
      SQL >	 ALTER DATABASE COMMIT TO SWITCHOVER TO PRIMARY WITH SESSION SHUTDOWN;  

8. **Monitor Switchback Progress:**
   - Monitor the switchback progress using:
      SQL >	SELECT SWITCHOVER_STATUS FROM V$DATABASE; 
Monitor the alert logfile for more information.

9. **Verify Switchover Success:**
   - Confirm the switchover success on both the primary and standby databases.
   	- New primary > select name,status,instance_name,open_mode,database_role, switchover_status from gv$database,gv$instance;

-It is showing database is open mode. And restart the database for get into open mode. 
	Startup the new standby database.
	- New stand by > select name, status, instance_name, open_mode,database_role, switchover_status from gv$database,gv$instance;

-It is showing database is mount mode.
Enable the archive destinations on current primary database and disable the archive destination_2 on Previous primary database.
 And start the synchronisation(MRP0) on current standby database.

10. **Adjust Client Connections:**
   - Update client connections to point to the new primary database.
